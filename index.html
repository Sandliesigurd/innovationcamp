<h2>Our Product</h2>

<p>
    ∙The appearance of the NOvid is circular.<br>
    ∙NOvid is waterproof because it is mainly for children, and should withstand play (with water) and fun.<br>
    ∙It emits a vibration and a constant red light along the edge of the chip when it is within 1.25m from another.<br>
    ∙NOvid is powered by a watch battery that is found in quartz watches, and lasts for about 1-2 years.<br>
    ∙NOvid is on an NFC (near field communication) docking and will be activated as soon as it’s removed.<br>
    ∙NOvid is attached with a clip, similar to a small microphone used in TV broadcasts.<br>
    ∙It will be possible to personally customize a cover with an individual design that the pin can be placed in.<br>
    ∙NOvid will be approximately the same size as a 42mm wristwatch.
